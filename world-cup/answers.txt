Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I expected a bigger difference from the results after I ran more than 100 simulations.
They were closer than I expected.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

1000 / The default. Because it had roughly the same outcome as 10000 or 100000 simulations.
100 simulations didn't produce an accurate enough result for me although being quite near it.
