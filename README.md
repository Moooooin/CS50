## About CS50

[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) is Harvard University's introduction to computer science. It covers a broad range of topics including algorithms, software development, web development, and more. It's free for everyone and I highly recommend taking it.
Feel free to explore my projects and take inspiration, but please do not copy anything!
