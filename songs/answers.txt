In this scenario I would characterize the adio aura by taking the averages
of energy, valence, and danceability of a personâ€™s top 100 songs from the past year.

Because they might listen to some songs with e.g. a very high level of energy and
a couple with a very low one. It wouldn't cancel out the outliers from an equasion
leaving the user with a moderately high level of energy which should be higher in this example.
